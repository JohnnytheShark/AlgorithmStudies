# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming starts by solving subproblems and builds up to solving the big problem. 

Think of the problem as a grid of possible options. Each row of the grid starts with a possibility and each column is the limitations we have in place. 

We want to create an algorithm going through the different rows checking for possiblities to get to the final conclusion.
